RKHS.py contains code for the non-zero polynomial of degree 2 RKHS.

The kernel for RKHS can be chagned by updating feature_map function.

The RKHS can be changed by updating weights.

In this example, random points from randomly generated dataspace are being used for evaluation of RKHS. There are many ways to generate data to evaluate a new RKHS however the simplest may be to manually pass points in eval_RKHS.
